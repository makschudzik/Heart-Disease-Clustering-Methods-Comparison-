# Heart-Disease-Clustering-Methods-Comparison-

This project explores different clustering algorithms to identify meaningful patterns in the heart disease dataset. It includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation to determine the most effective clustering method.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This notebook covers the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** - Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and scaling the data.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction** - Using PCA to reduce data complexity while retaining critical features.
3. **Model Training and Clustering** - Testing multiple clustering algorithms including KMeans, MeanShift, Gaussian Mixture, and K-Neighbors.
4. **Evaluation** - Comparing models using the Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Score.
5. **Visualization** - Generating informative plots to visualize clustering effectiveness.

## üìä Results
Initial analysis shows that **KMeans** provides the best clustering performance based on the chosen evaluation metrics. This suggests that the heart disease data can be effectively grouped using this approach.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from Kaggle:  
[Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)  

Please download the dataset and place the `hearts.csv` file in the root directory of this repository before running the notebook.
